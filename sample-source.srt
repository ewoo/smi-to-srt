1
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,917
Your pupil is on TV, Dad.

2
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,334
Really?

3
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,334
Did he contact you?

4
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,792
We had tea and he walked me home.

5
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:22,667
Ip Man was my Dad.

6
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,876
Judging from his scholarly appearance.

7
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,001
Few could tell that
he's a martial arts expert

8
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,667
and Master to a world
renowned action star.

9
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,667
My parents both hailed

10
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:36,751
from wealthy Foshan families.

11
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,209
Nothing was lacking in our family

12
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,167
until the Japanese came

13
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:45,834
and seized everything we had.

14
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,376
My two young sisters
were starved to death.

15
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,542
Dad believed a man should see the world,

16
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,001
and he's a man-of-his-own-word.

17
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:03,126
Despite his chronic stomach illness,

18
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,917
he came alone to Hong Kong in 1949.

19
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:39,209
Where is this place?

20
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:40,876
Over there!

21
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:42,751
Thank you!

22
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,334
You're welcome!

23
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:16,334
Coming.

24
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:19,751
Who is it?

25
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,501
I'm looking for Lee Man, my name is lp.

26
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:27,751
Master lp

27
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,542
Lee's out but he told me to expect you.

28
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,292
Come in.

29
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,751
My name is Leung Sheung.

30
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,167
They say you're famous in Foshan.

31
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,917
Perhaps I can see for myself?

32
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,834
You will, someday.

33
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,417
Why not today?

34
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,834
Please?

35
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,001
Not on an empty stomach!

36
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,209
Hungry? Be right back!

37
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,751
I'm a martial artist myself,

38
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,584
but I've never come across Wing Chun.

39
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:20,751
I'd love to see it!

40
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,667
I hear it was invented by a woman

41
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,001
and that it's awesome.

42
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,001
I'm ready...

43
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,334
when you are, Master lp!

44
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,667
Let me clear the room...

45
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,417
Don't bother!

46
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,417
You win if you knock me off
this newspaper.

47
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,042
Are you alright?

48
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:35,917
I'm fine!

49
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,626
Please take me as your pupil, Master lp.

50
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,417
Let's talk after lunch.

51
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,876
Try our local specialty,

52
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,042
meal-on-a-plate.

53
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:10,084
Indeed, all-in-one!

54
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,376
Fewer dishes to wash, too.

55
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,459
No more four-course meals these days.

56
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:20,001
That was a lifetime ago for me.

57
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,501
The recent influx of immigrants

58
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:24,876
made it hard to make a living.

59
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:28,667
You won't get a job without a sponsor.

60
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,251
But you must have good connections,

61
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,042
so that shouldn't be a problem.

62
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,917
You don't really need a job,

63
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,084
just open a martial arts school.

64
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,167
Not unless it's absolutely necessary.

65
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,542
Don't you want to teach?

66
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,084
Yes, but I don't want to run a school.

67
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,584
Come this way...

68
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,501
This is Master lp.

69
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:56,834
Hello, Master lp.

70
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,459
Master lp is from Foshan.

71
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,334
His Wing Chun is awesome!

72
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,209
He'll give <i>lessons</i> on our rooftop
from now on.

73
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,917
Please help tidy up
the place and make room.

74
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,709
King! Sei Mui! Give us a hand!

75
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,209
This way, Master!

76
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:11,709
With capability comes strong personalities,

77
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:14,251
making it hard to find a sponsor,

78
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,792
and hence a job.

79
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,709
But such is fate.

80
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,501
If Master had a cushy desk job,

81
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,792
he may not have
become the Grandmaster that he is.

82
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:25,626
If I wasn't heading the Restaurant

83
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,792
Worker's Union

84
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,542
and had a say in most things,

85
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,334
he may never have taught on our rooftop,

86
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:37,209
and I couldn't have
introduced Wing Chun to others.

87
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,251
Barbecued pork buns!

88
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,876
Chan Sei Mui is a dim sum girl.

89
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,626
She's a huge fan of martial arts novels,

90
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:46,417
dreams of upholding justice
like her fictional heroines.

91
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,376
Tang Sing is a cop

92
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:54,251
who doesn't say much
to anyone but Master

93
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:58,376
and keeps everything to himself.

94
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,792
Lee King is the darling of her factory.

95
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:05,126
She's tough with a strong sense of justice,

96
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,709
often speaking out for fellow workers.

97
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,667
You should make hay instead!

98
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,917
Wong Tung is a prison warden

99
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,084
who's a quick learner.

100
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:21,751
Master says he has a temper like a bull.

101
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,251
Ng Chan is a tram driver

102
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,584
and Wong Tung's best friend.

103
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,876
People come from all walks of life.

104
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,209
Yet Master has three "unteachables"

105
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:35,459
Halfwits,

106
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,126
wise guys,

107
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,667
and those who can't make ends meet

108
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,251
have no business learning kung-fu.

109
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,292
I think what made him the Grandmaster

110
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,251
was his no-nonsense teaching apprachi.

111
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,542
He's flexible and never rigid,

112
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,376
so all pupils can learn quickly.

113
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,792
Some are always itching to pick a fight.

114
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,084
That move doesn't count!

115
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:58,042
What are you doing?

116
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,459
Hey...

117
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,584
Enough bullshit! What do you want?

118
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,917
Bullshit? What about you?

119
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,459
You're a lousy player, spare me the crap!

120
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,376
I dare you to repeat that!

121
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:13,459
With pleasure! This is chess and you're shit!

122
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,001
You're asking for a beating!

123
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,209
You don't scare me!

124
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,209
They seem to know kung-fu.

125
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,001
This is Wing Chin!

126
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,292
The hell it is!

127
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,376
Screw you!

128
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,626
Police? I want to report a brawl!

129
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,376
Please hurry!

130
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,417
I'm not finished with you! Come back...

131
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,709
What about the damages?

132
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,417
Hey!

133
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:53,584
Take this!

134
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:56,417
50 cents? Hey...

135
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,209
Come back, kid!

136
00:09:58,542 --> 00:09:59,334
Another mess!

137
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:01,417
What do you want me to do?

138
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,459
Play deaf, dumb or blind?

139
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,209
We learn from the same Master,

140
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,876
turn a blind eye!

141
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:11,751
Tang Sing,

142
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,001
we're both civil servants.

143
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:15,876
You don't scare me

144
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,417
because you're no better than I am.

145
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,042
You put criminals behind bars,

146
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,626
and I watch over them.

147
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,167
So who's more important?

148
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,917
You, of course!

149
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,751
But you trashed someone's shop
He called us,

150
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:32,417
and the case is booked.

151
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,667
Tell me what to do!

152
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,834
Figure it out! You're the cop!

153
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,209
I taught you for a year

154
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,126
and you go around picking fights.

155
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,376
If I teach you for another year

156
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,751
either you will kill someone

157
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,084
or someone will kill you.

158
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:02,292
Kung-fu is pointless if you can't use it.

159
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,709
It is not about picking fights.

160
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,334
Kung-fu is about developing your
physical well being.

161
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,834
There are other ways to achieve that.

162
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,542
Jogging, skipping rope, football, swimming...

163
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,334
Then why don't you jog?

164
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,251
Stop the backchat!

165
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:24,209
If I teach you how to swim

166
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,584
you can swim far or save a life.

167
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,626
But never push others into the sea.

168
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:37,292
Kung-fu is not about picking fights.

169
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:41,209
Only brutes use force, wise men use virtue.

170
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,917
When practicing kung-fu, integrity is vital.

171
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,084
Here's your punishment...

172
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,209
Polish the wooden dummy.

173
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:21,542
Master!

174
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,792
Everyone wants to do good.

175
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,376
But in reality

176
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,876
it's never up to us.

177
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,209
Even if you can't help it,

178
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,709
at least try not to hurt someone.

179
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,251
I'm really confused.

180
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,209
What's right and wrong?

181
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,042
I can't tell anymore.

182
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,417
Follow your conscience?
Or go with the flow?

183
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,667
You must choose carefully!

184
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,084
Wing Sing!

185
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:49,501
Wing Sing!

186
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:50,542
Man!

187
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,459
Hong Kong's specialty, "meal-on-a-plate".

188
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:23,084
Tofu, pork, beef and vegetables.

189
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,542
Four courses...

190
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:26,792
Let's eat!

191
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,584
Something wrong?

192
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,376
I wish Chun were here.

193
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,417
I told you to bring him,

194
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,084
but you wanted to check things out first.

195
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,751
He just enrolled in a good Foshan school,

196
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,876
I don't want to unsettle him.

197
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,667
When he's here,

198
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,376
I'll order an extra dish.

199
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,042
A six-course meal!

200
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:56,542
Let's eat!

201
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,834
12th November 1950

202
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,667
I thought this blanket is warm enough.

203
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,917
But the cold weather has surprised me.

204
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,501
It's not big enough for both of us.

205
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,417
Take it!

206
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,584
Your hands are cold!

207
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,417
I'll pass you some of my inner strength.

208
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,917
Who could it be at this hour?

209
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,751
I'll get it, it's drafty out there!

210
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:58,917
Master!

211
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,917
What is it?

212
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,459
We have something for Mrs. lp.

213
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,751
You're very pretty, Mrs. lp.

214
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:05,917
Master!

215
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,459
Thank you!

216
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,209
We'll let you get back to bed, good night!

217
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,584
Good night!

218
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,626
I thought you've a lot to tell me.

219
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,584
I thought so too.

220
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,334
Mine is a wrinkled face.

221
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,001
Don't look at me like that!

222
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,876
My blurry eyes can't spot wrinkles.

223
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,584
I can back away... better now?

224
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,084
No, the closer the better!

225
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,459
Strike!

226
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,334
Back then four unions staged a strike,

227
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,126
other unions rallied in support.

228
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:16,709
The relationship between
employers and workers worsened.

229
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:21,042
As the union chief, I was caught in the middle.

230
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,917
Meetings have become highly confrontational.

231
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,334
My foreman worked for
3 years 7 months and 10 days

232
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,417
without taking a single day off.

233
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:35,709
It took the boss just one minute to fire him!

234
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,251
Most employers have no conscience!

235
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:41,126
Calm down! Let's talk, alright?

236
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:42,751
Our boss owes us

237
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,751
two months' pay,

238
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,792
and just sacked a pregnant colleague.

239
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,334
Leung Sheung, you head our union.

240
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,167
Will the union stand up for us?

241
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,792
Leung,

242
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:58,292
I was fired for being an unionist.

243
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,376
I lost my job.

244
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,084
What will happen to me?

245
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:03,584
How can I feed my family of six?

246
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,417
You have done nothing.

247
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,876
Do you want me to pull a knife on him?

248
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:08,709
I know how you feel

249
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,167
but it's no use to be reckless.

250
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,459
Please calm down!

251
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,126
How?

252
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,626
Let's call a general strike!

253
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,792
Show the bosses we mean business!

254
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,042
Then there'll be no way back!

255
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,334
You're such a wimp!

256
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,751
No, he just wants to save his own ass.

257
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,126
Your boss gave you lucky money.

258
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,292
That was for the New Year.

259
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,126
Everybody got it!

260
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,209
Be reasonable!

261
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,417
But Leung Sheung had a big one!

262
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,501
What are you hinting at? Don't slander me.

263
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:43,667
How do you know I got more than others?

264
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,209
It goes without saying!

265
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,417
Listen to me!

266
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,334
A strike is effective.

267
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:51,792
You read the newspapers.

268
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,042
The bus drivers got what they wanted.

269
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:59,209
But the head of the tram union was deported.

270
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,417
So? Are you scared?

271
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,792
Your move!

272
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,792
Master!

273
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:08,709
Whose side are you on?
Everyone chipped in for the gift.

274
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:09,751
Stop yelling!

275
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,542
You'll cost us our jobs!

276
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,792
Mind your tongue!

277
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,167
Speak your mind but don't yell at the ladies.

278
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,292
Stop pointing!
I've been more than reasonable!

279
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,251
She started it!

280
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,126
Just whose side are you on?

281
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,251
Can't you tell how much

282
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,834
I have done for you?

283
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:25,917
For me?

284
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,626
My family hasn't eaten in three days!

285
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,084
They're starving.
And you, you're a turncoat...

286
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:30,834
What? You want to pick a fight?

287
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,334
Don't... Let's talk...

288
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:35,709
Well? You want to fight?

289
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,209
Let me...

290
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,709
Sing, let go of him!

291
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,834
Listen to me!

292
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,792
If you don't stick together,

293
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,542
how can you stand up for yourselves?

294
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,042
Sing, are you mad at me?

295
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,334
I was thinking, Hong Kong isn't any better.

296
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,584
Maybe it's time to go back to Foshan.

297
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,501
Stop!

298
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:45,751
Don't let him work!

299
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:50,876
Strike!

300
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,501
We want a pay rise!

301
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:56,417
Strike!

302
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,167
Strike!

303
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,417
We demand a pay rise!

304
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,042
Strike!

305
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:23,167
Pay rise! Pay rise!

306
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:27,584
Strike!

307
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,292
Break them up!

308
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:30,792
Break them up!

309
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,126
Yes, Sir!

310
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,667
Are you okay, Sir?

311
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,126
Go, go!

312
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,792
Let go of me!

313
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:28,542
She's done this before. But this time...

314
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,001
she beat up a gweilo (foreigner)!

315
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,251
I'm Chinese and only a constable,

316
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,209
I've done everything I could.

317
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,334
I hope you'll understand.

318
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,126
When was the last time you attended class?

319
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:46,917
I have been very busy.

320
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:51,834
The workers are striking during the day,

321
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,042
and meeting illegally at night.

322
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,042
I take English lessons on Saturdays,

323
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,459
and target practice on Sundays.

324
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,626
Passing the review board,

325
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,751
is very important to me.

326
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,417
A turtle jelly, please!

327
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,209
Sure!

328
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:08,209
Master!

329
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,751
Does Mrs. lp feel at home here?

330
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:12,792
That's good!

331
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,584
Did Lee King really beat up the gweilo?

332
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,042
Not personally,

333
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,709
but she was with the mob.

334
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,292
No sugar?

335
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,667
Next time I'll teach you "Sticking Hands".

336
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:44,167
The gun you use is foreign,

337
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:46,709
but your fists are your own.

338
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,709
You can point your gun at anyone,

339
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:51,376
but never use fists against your own kind.

340
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,542
My treat.

341
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,542
It can help you think clearly.

342
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:23,376
Sir!

343
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,834
I want to release the girl Lee King.

344
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,001
Lee King?

345
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,292
Lee King? Are you serious?

346
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,334
She hit my head!

347
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,167
Sorry, Sir!

348
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:50,084
Sorry, Sir!

349
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:51,292
Sorry, Sir!

350
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,376
Sorry!

351
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,542
Lee King, you may go!

352
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:19,709
First you arrested me, now you let me go.

353
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:21,334
I'm not sure if I sould thank you.

354
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:25,209
Violence is not the only option.

355
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,792
I only know that you work for running dogs.

356
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,542
Running dogs?

357
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,792
Is Tang Sing coming?

358
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,667
I've told him about
our farewell dinner for Mrs. lp.

359
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,084
What did he say?

360
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:48,417
He said...

361
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,667
Never mind, he knows about it.

362
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:56,209
You're setting a huge table.

363
00:25:56,792 --> 00:26:00,209
Master has invited
an old friend and his family.

364
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,001
It was destiny...

365
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,209
Have some tea, Mrs. Lee.

366
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:07,626
It's fate...

367
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,751
that we ran into each other!
Have some tea, Mr. Lee

368
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:09,751
Thank you!

369
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:11,917
You don't have to be so courteous,

370
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,876
I'm no longer a boss.

371
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,376
I've prepared your favorite rice wine.

372
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,667
Let's have a toast...

373
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,251
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. lp.

374
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,417
Don't mention it.

375
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,792
Good girl!

376
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,542
Times are different now.

377
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,709
Everyone is having a hard time.

378
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:32,501
It's good to see old friends from home.

379
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:36,709
Thank you for looking after us during the War.

380
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:37,917
That was nothing!

381
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:40,334
Let me toast you!

382
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,667
Cheers! Have some tea!

383
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:49,709
Mrs. lp!

384
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:52,834
When will you come back from Foshan?

385
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,084
Not until Chun is on holiday.

386
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,542
Chun is now in college.

387
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:01,751
Congratulations!

388
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:03,917
The chicken is ready...

389
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,584
Let's dig in!

390
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,209
Let's eat!

391
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,459
The best behaved gets the drumstick!

392
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,751
I bet it's you.

393
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:16,501
Here's a drumstick for you.

394
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:17,917
Say thank you.

395
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,917
We don't want drumsticks.

396
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,334
Leave it for our baby brother.

397
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:22,834
Very well!

398
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,501
Speaking of him...

399
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:28,334
Where is the baby, Mrs. Lee?

400
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,209
Mom...

401
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,542
I didn't eat any drumstick.

402
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,417
Please don't sell us!

403
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:39,084
Don't sell me, Mom!

404
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,792
You still don't get it, do you?

405
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,876
Baby brother was sold not
because he ate drumsticks.

406
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:50,584
Mom sold him for money to feed us.

407
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,084
It wasn't my idea,

408
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,292
it was your Dad's.

409
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:11,501
I'm so sorry...

410
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,251
Mrs. Lee!

411
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,792
Mom...

412
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:27,876
I can't feed a family of eight,

413
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,167
I had to sell one

414
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,167
to feed the others.

415
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,709
Shame on me!

416
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,667
If one can't even make ends meet,

417
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,459
what good is kung-fu to him?

418
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,834
I can't even help a friend in need.

419
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:58,876
Keep your papers safe.

420
00:29:59,084 --> 00:29:59,542
Sure!

421
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,876
Take as much as you can,
Chun needs them for school.

422
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:06,751
You're not taking this?

423
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:10,292
No, I'll do the buttons
and pockets when I return.

424
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:28,209
That was the last time I saw Mrs. lp.

425
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,209
Because on New Year's Day in 1950

426
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:32,126
border restrictions were suddenly enforced.

427
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,667
Mrs. lp was not allowed to
return to Hong Kong.

428
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,376
Master didn't seem
to mind living alone, though.

429
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,417
He carried on as usual,

430
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,626
but I have often seen him lost in solitude.

431
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,667
Barbecued pork buns!

432
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,792
Radish cake!

433
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,292
Barbecued pork buns!

434
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,376
Coming...

435
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:12,292
The latest issue! Put it away!

436
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,417
I'm on duty! Want anything?

437
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,084
Barbecued pork buns.

438
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,334
Barbecued pork buns.

439
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,292
Tea please!

440
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:21,626
Remember... do it slowly.

441
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,876
Don't rush... get it?

442
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:24,626
Yes!

443
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,834
What are you staring at? Stay focused!

444
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:32,792
Right!

445
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:34,709
Brother Sing!

446
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,334
Please watch out for us.

447
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,792
Take good care of Brother Sing for me!

448
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:41,792
Brother Sing!

449
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,126
It's warm in here,

450
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:45,084
take off your cap.

451
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:46,876
I'm fine.

452
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:48,167
Cheers!

453
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:50,709
Take it off!

454
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,042
He's bald!

455
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,167
He looks funny!

456
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,209
Please give it back!

457
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:05,876
I have to go.

458
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:10,209
These girls are impudent!

459
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,917
Don't be upset, please come again!

460
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:57,584
This is for you!

461
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:01,084
Thank you, Sir!

462
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,292
It was said no half decent man
would want to be a cop,

463
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,709
who was no more than
a thug dressed in uniform.

464
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:35,584
And those gweilos stuck
their noses in everything,

465
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:37,626
except the Walled City,

466
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,042
which was rife with criminal activities.

467
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:41,917
Even the police were reluctant to go inside.

468
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,584
Ordinary citizens only

469
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,709
go to nearby streets

470
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,251
for cheap dental work.

471
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,834
Who calls the shots there?

472
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:51,792
Have a seat over there, Master!

473
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,792
A local tyrant, no less!

474
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:56,209
There's a gang boss in the walled city

475
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,001
known as Dragon.

476
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:01,167
Legend has it that, on a stormy day,

477
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:05,834
he came out of nowhere,
stood in the courtyard,

478
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,542
raised a flag and shouted three times.

479
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,126
Since then,

480
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:21,376
armed with an icepick,

481
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,084
and his powerful kicks,

482
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:28,376
he challenged every gang inside the City,

483
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:32,251
and fought his way to the top.

484
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,209
From now on, the Walled City is mine!

485
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,501
He ends up controlling
everything inside the Walled City.

486
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,042
Does Dragon really exist?

487
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,001
Of course! He's the local despot!

488
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,584
We seldom see Tang Sing after his promotion.

489
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:24,751
PC1759

490
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:25,751
Yes!

491
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,209
But he would send money
every now and then.

492
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,751
Please give this to Master Ip.

493
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:30,376
Yes, Sir!

494
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:32,001
Saying it's his tution fee.

495
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,584
The others chipped in financially,

496
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,042
and took turns looking after Master.

497
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,417
Master!

498
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,209
Time for your medication.

499
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,626
Be careful, it's hot!

500
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:53,376
Yeung Siu-tong!

501
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,084
In 1953,

502
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:58,126
I lost the union election.

503
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:00,001
Leung Sheung!

504
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,126
Auyeung Chi-ming is elected!

505
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,167
It's their loss for electing someone else.

506
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,376
But Master could no longer
teach on the rooftop.

507
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:17,876
It was decided

508
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,876
we'll chip in and rent a place

509
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,167
for him to open a school.

510
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,709
He refused at first.

511
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,751
But we finally convinced him.

512
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:29,334
Yet he was adament about
not putting up signage,

513
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,126
because...

514
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:33,209
A signboard means business.

515
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:36,834
You can't buy kung-fu
like you do with abalones.

516
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:46,876
Let go of me!

517
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:49,042
You can't hide from me, junkie!

518
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,584
I'm only two days behind.

519
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,251
Don't push me too hard!

520
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,459
You'll get nothing if I die.

521
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,209
I won't let you die!

522
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,292
Now move it! Let go of me!

523
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:01,876
Stop it! How much does she owe you?

524
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,917
$10, including interest.

525
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:09,626
Take the money and leave!

526
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,751
Get lost!

527
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,417
Thank you. I'll pay you back!

528
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:18,584
Don't worry about it.

529
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:21,917
Just kick the habit!

530
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,209
I tried, but failed!

531
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,417
They say life is like a dream.

532
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:38,751
But I say dreams reflect life.

533
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:42,417
A toast to the new school and more pupils

534
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,209
who can fight like me!

535
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,459
Stop boasting!

536
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,584
Cheers!

537
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,292
Do you have a wish, Master?

538
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,751
I wish you'd spare me trouble.

539
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:55,584
He means you!

540
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,459
He means you!

541
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:00,334
Master!

542
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,584
What is it?

543
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:06,209
Never mind... it's nothing!

544
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,209
Why can't you just say it?

545
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:12,876
Master!

546
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,084
In fact...

547
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,917
I have an announcement to make.

548
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,376
King and I are getting married.

549
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,167
Good!

550
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,042
Like me,
you sure have eye for a good wife!

551
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:28,626
Congratulations! Cheers!

552
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:29,917
King!

553
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,292
Didn't I tell you?

554
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,167
You'll get your man for sure!

555
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,167
Let's dance, Sei Mui!

556
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:37,667
Please join us, Master!

557
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,209
We're going...

558
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,209
They say life is like a dream.

559
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:49,167
But I say dreams reflect life

560
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:54,209
that is full of separations and reunions.

561
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,209
A short life

562
00:38:56,209 --> 00:39:00,709
embraces old age and youth.

563
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,917
Dazzling nights,

564
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,584
melancholic mornings.

565
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,917
Angels in Hell,

566
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,209
phantoms in Heaven.

567
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,334
When you wake from your dream,

568
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:21,042
you realize you're at
the end of your journey.

569
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:27,876
Thank you!

570
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,001
Bravo!

571
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:32,917
Thank you!

572
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:35,126
Thank you!

573
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,126
Hello!

574
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,501
Jenny!

575
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:42,709
You sing, I write.

576
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:46,626
I can make you a star
through my columns.

577
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:48,209
No, thank you!

578
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:51,376
Don't tell me you're not for sale!

579
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:57,292
I'll share a drink with you.

580
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:57,917
Alright!

581
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,542
Thank you!

582
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:04,709
You sure can drink!

583
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,334
One more toast, then!

584
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,209
Very well!

585
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:14,626
How dare you!

586
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,001
Out of my way!

587
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,751
Go to Hell!

588
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:22,709
That's enough!

589
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:24,042
Stupid old fart!

590
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,501
It's spicy...

591
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:35,126
Help! It's spicy hot...

592
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:36,834
Sorry!

593
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:37,542
You have a lot of nerve!

594
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,001
You bet! That's Wing Chun!

595
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,542
Are you alright, Miss?

596
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,167
Thank you!

597
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,084
May I know your name, sir?

598
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,292
I'm just a nobody.

599
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,209
You sang well!

600
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,792
Thank you!

601
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,834
Vamp!

602
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,292
Master, we're attacked by
Wing Chun school!

603
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,001
That's right!

604
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:12,667
This is outrageous!

605
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:25,292
We have no quarrels with you.

606
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,334
Why did you beat up my pupils?

607
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,209
Who are your pupils?

608
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,417
Masters...

609
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:33,626
That's him!

610
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,209
He said our school is useless.

611
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,542
He even verbally abused your parents!

612
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:37,709
Fix him good!

613
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:18,917
Shortly after 11 last night

614
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:22,334
a peculiar mass brawl broke out

615
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,292
at Temple Street in Yaumatei.

616
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,417
Thank you!

617
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,001
Feel free to browse.

618
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:35,876
Newcomer Wing Chun
took on the famous Pak Hok

619
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,292
and fought for supremacy.

620
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:45,001
Each school sent out its best fighters

621
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:49,001
in one of the most earth-shattering battles.

622
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:50,584
Master of the Wing Chun school...

623
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:53,251
They misspelt your name as lp Mon!

624
00:42:56,209 --> 00:43:00,917
Who leapt onto rooftops
and walked on walls,

625
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:05,542
routed Pak Hok's twin-sword assault,

626
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,084
and devastated everything in sight.

627
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:15,126
Pak Hok suffered heavy casualties.

628
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,626
How exaggerated!

629
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:20,709
Pak Hok kung-fu Academy

630
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,209
Master...

631
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:26,292
They made us out to be a bunch of wimps!

632
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:28,292
I read it.

633
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,042
We must teach them a lesson.

634
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,501
We don't always have to resort to violence.

635
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,292
Diplomacy!

636
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:39,042
I'll post my thoughts in the newspaper.

637
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,084
The falling leaves understand the world's worries,

638
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:46,209
while the cicadas are oblivious
to departing sorrow.

639
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,709
If the spring breeze doesn't care
for the rain on the eaves,

640
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:52,209
why should the setting sun care
about staying or leaving?

641
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:56,751
What does it mean?

642
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:00,126
It means lp Mon...

643
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:03,042
It's Master Ip Man

644
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:05,626
Very well... this lp Man

645
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:07,584
shouldn't let his pupils loose when

646
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:11,667
he can't even care for himself.

647
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,459
That's complete nonsense!

648
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,876
That's not what happened.

649
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,542
A wandering leaf

650
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,126
is free to go anywhere.

651
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:28,584
Self discipline always comes before fame.

652
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:32,209
There's no end to learning
and practicing kung-fu.

653
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:37,917
Master lp says even
though he's not settled down,

654
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,042
he has few worries.

655
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:45,126
His concern is self discipline over fame,

656
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,584
and he is very sure of himself.

657
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,417
What he doesn't know, though

658
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:53,292
is how powerful his opponent is.

659
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:57,417
A scholar and a warrior!

660
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,542
Hurry, it's almost showtime!

661
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,334
Is Master lp in?

662
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:06,501
Who is it?

663
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:07,334
He's inside.

664
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,042
Ng Chung from the Pak Hok School.

665
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,209
A small gift.

666
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:14,667
I'll take care of Master Ng.

667
00:45:15,084 --> 00:45:16,042
In order of seniority,

668
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,042
it's surely my duty.

669
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:21,001
I must receive Master Ng personally.

670
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:28,376
I was most impressed by
the imagery of your poem.

671
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:31,209
And I truly admire yours, too

672
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:33,292
and share your sentiment
one one line in particular.

673
00:45:34,126 --> 00:45:35,251
Which is...

674
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:37,542
There's no end to learning
and practicing kung-fu.

675
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:40,834
It makes me even more curious
about Wing Chun.

676
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,917
Shall we compare notes in private?

677
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:48,584
With pleasure!

678
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,584
Leave us alone!

679
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,667
Sei Mui, let me take a peep!

680
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:21,876
Where did they go? Come on...

681
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:47,751
I almost broke your furniture, apologies.

682
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:49,792
Thanks for the oranges, Master Ng.

683
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:52,126
They're coming out!

684
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:56,334
Master Ng!

685
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:57,709
Master lp!

686
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,042
Keep it up!

687
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:18,209
Bravo!

688
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:23,501
Wing Chun Academy

689
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,834
Your patronage will be greatly appreciated...

690
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:28,417
Bravo!

691
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,459
You're not angry, Master?

692
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:48,626
But I am!

693
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:52,209
How can he open a school?
He's still a beginner!

694
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:53,834
We can still use this mug.

695
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:57,376
Did he have your blessing?

696
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,042
Yes!

697
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,876
Did he tell you

698
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:02,709
his school is across the street from yours?

699
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:03,501
That, he didn't!

700
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:08,459
How can you tolerate this?

701
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,584
Ng Chan

702
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,542
Master lp

703
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:34,834
You jacket is rather unusual.

704
00:49:35,126 --> 00:49:36,501
There are neither buttons nor pockets!

705
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:53,876
One slice is enough.

706
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:57,834
Is it too sour?

707
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,584
No, it's my stomach...

708
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,376
Then you must avoid anything acidic.

709
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:10,042
Sorry, I don't want to waste food.

710
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:26,667
What can I do for you, Miss Jenny?

711
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:31,376
I was looking for someone
to address an envelope,

712
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:34,501
when I thought I'd drop by
to show gratitude.

713
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:36,751
Address an envelope?

714
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:47,126
I've to send a photo

715
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:49,584
to my aunt in San Francisco

716
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:52,251
for match-making.

717
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:55,209
The address...

718
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,209
has to be in English.

719
00:50:57,876 --> 00:50:59,751
I'd pay someone to do it.

720
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:05,251
I learnt English at school here,

721
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,167
perhaps I can help.

722
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:10,626
That's great!

723
00:51:15,084 --> 00:51:16,459
Should the recipient's name be in Chinese?

724
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:36,751
Yes, I think that should be okay.

725
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:44,917
I hope you'll find your Mr. Right.

726
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:30,209
Robbery...

727
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:31,292
Stop the thief!

728
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,209
Stop! Police!

729
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:37,001
A cop!

730
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:38,417
A cop is in here!

731
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,251
A cop!

732
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,751
A cop has come in!

733
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:46,584
Police brutality!

734
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,834
I work for Dragon

735
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:49,501
Shut up!

736
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:10,417
Officer Tang.

737
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:12,626
I've heard of you.

738
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:14,751
What do you want?

739
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:19,417
I hear you like to help people.

740
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:26,084
I do what I can.

741
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:31,709
I know you're vying with Kam

742
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:32,917
to be the next Chief Inspector.

743
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,334
You're well informed.

744
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:37,584
But...

745
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:40,709
if Kam was chosen for this job,

746
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:42,459
he won't be much help to anyone.

747
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:44,042
But you're different.

748
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:45,209
Am I right?

749
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,334
You should work with someone with ability.

750
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:53,626
I like helping people too.

751
00:53:54,376 --> 00:53:55,126
Chief Inspector Tang!

752
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:56,792
I'm just a sergeant.

753
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,542
This money...

754
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:10,126
should be enough to get you there.

755
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:17,417
You want me to become Chief Inspector?

756
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:18,584
Yes!

757
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:23,917
Because you can then help...

758
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:25,376
anyone you want.

759
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:30,167
There's a lion dance contest In two days.

760
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:35,376
Pak Hok's Ng Chung is favoured to win.

761
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,334
But I think...

762
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:40,667
the winner should be Chun Wai's Ngai Ba-tin.

763
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:46,042
Do you think God will grant me my wish?

764
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,042
It doesn't smell!

765
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:13,042
Ngai Tong? You're under arrest!

766
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,667
What have I done? Shut up! Move it!

767
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:15,751
Why?

768
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:23,751
Luk Fu

769
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:24,376
Yes?

770
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:25,209
Come with us!

771
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:33,917
Two of our men have been arrested.

772
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:36,251
Can we still compete?

773
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:41,792
I won't buckle!

774
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,292
We're on!

775
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:44,334
Right!

776
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,126
Sing is over there, Master.

777
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:28,292
Why doesn't he come over and say hello?

778
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:30,876
Let's sit down!

779
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:57,709
Those lions are ganging up on Master Ng.

780
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:23,376
Master!

781
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,084
Come up!

782
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:38,167
Hold on to me!

783
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:57,834
Are you here to compete or to fight?

784
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,251
Give them a hand!

785
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:02,209
VB

786
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:05,626
What should we do, Sir?

787
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:06,792
Let them fight!

788
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,126
Escort the officials out!

789
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:09,876
Please follow me!

790
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:15,584
Let's

791
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:27,209
Beware of the needles on his sleeves!

792
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:35,209
Master Ngai!

793
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,167
Let's call it a day?

794
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:39,292
I'll only take orders from...

795
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,834
the one who defeats me.

796
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:25,376
My apologies, Master Ngai!

797
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,209
You have a lot of nerve!

798
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:32,251
Let's

799
01:00:39,376 --> 01:00:40,834
Our medicated wine is not bad,

800
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,292
infused with eagle claws
and bear gall bladders.

801
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:45,709
You can either drink or apply it.

802
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:48,626
What a way to make a living,

803
01:00:48,626 --> 01:00:49,917
drinking medicated wine.

804
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:53,001
It's tough heading up a school.

805
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:56,917
People are fooled by
our cheerful demeanor.

806
01:00:57,792 --> 01:01:00,209
But we're actually under great pressure.

807
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,876
I'm sure you'd understand!

808
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:06,876
My wife used to adore me.

809
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:09,167
Because I know kung-fu,

810
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,584
it gave her a sense of security.

811
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:13,709
We got married, then I opened the school.

812
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:15,584
I was challenged day in and out.

813
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:18,751
So she felt unsafe and insecure,

814
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:21,917
and opts for just about anyone else

815
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:22,876
but a kung-fu instructor.

816
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:24,626
How fickle a woman can be!

817
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,626
Master Ng,

818
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:30,709
you have such literary talent,

819
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:32,709
you can be a school teacher.

820
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:34,209
You are far superior, Master lp.

821
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:37,626
I can't blame her, though.

822
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:40,292
Young thugs are always at the door.

823
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:42,542
Finally I found a solution.

824
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,292
What solution?

825
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:48,876
Between you and me...

826
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:50,126
it's very simple.

827
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:52,084
Whenever a challenger turns up, I'd tell him...

828
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,042
I'm going to lock that door

829
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:55,501
and here's the key.

830
01:01:56,251 --> 01:01:59,209
If you want to leave, you have to kill me for it.

831
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:01,251
Or else...

832
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,209
run now before I kill you.

833
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:06,709
Nine out of 10 would leave right away.

834
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:08,042
What about the tenth?

835
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:10,417
The last one has guts,

836
01:02:11,209 --> 01:02:12,917
and he'd become my pupil.

837
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:15,917
Right?

838
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:22,167
It's hard for a pupil to find a good master.

839
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,001
But for a master to find good pupils,

840
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:26,751
it's even harder.

841
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:28,917
I can't agree with you more!

842
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:30,334
Have some tea!

843
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,209
Cheers!

844
01:02:39,209 --> 01:02:42,792
You must be careful with what you eat.

845
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:49,417
I cooked these myself.

846
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:53,417
As good as those from a restaurant.

847
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,376
A bit salty, though.

848
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:05,709
I'll pay you for it.

849
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,001
Please don't!

850
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:15,084
I washed these already.

851
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:22,501
If you like, I can cook for you again.

852
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:58,167
Wake up! Time to go to work!

853
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:04,084
Come on, get up!

854
01:04:05,084 --> 01:04:06,917
Get up...

855
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,876
Your friend died in peace.

856
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:29,709
I'm scared.

857
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:32,209
Of what?

858
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,876
Of being alone...

859
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:43,209
when I die.

860
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:52,376
Hello?

861
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:55,209
Please hold.

862
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:01,501
Master lp! A call for you!

863
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,792
Were you by Mom's side?

864
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:21,834
Master lp

865
01:05:23,459 --> 01:05:24,501
Are you alright?

866
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:32,626
In 1960, Hong Kong's economy was poor.

867
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:36,167
Life in Foshan was considerably more stable.

868
01:05:36,751 --> 01:05:40,251
Mom passed away in July that year.

869
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:44,209
I stayed with her until the very end.

870
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:17,209
Nothing too serious. Mr. lp was in shock.

871
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:18,334
Thank you, doctor.

872
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,584
They sent Dad to Queen Mary Hospital

873
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:24,834
Perhaps he was overcame with grief,

874
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:26,001
he didn't recognize anyone.

875
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:34,376
Master!

876
01:06:37,709 --> 01:06:38,917
Master!

877
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:44,584
Master!

878
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:49,667
He couldn't recognize any of us!

879
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,042
Wing Sing!

880
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:30,876
Don't you recognize me?

881
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,334
What are you doing here?

882
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,626
You should be in San Francisco for your date.

883
01:07:49,126 --> 01:07:50,501
I found him already.

884
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:04,626
Move over...

885
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:06,876
ready! Smile, Master!

886
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,209
Coming...

887
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:11,626
There's my wife.

888
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,001
Wong Tung and Sei Mui got married in 1961.

889
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:16,792
One more...

890
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,542
Wong Tung quit his job after he got married.

891
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,792
I don't know why.

892
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:25,626
Then he decided to teach kung-fu for a living.

893
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:28,667
He asked Master for a signboard,

894
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,251
and he inscribed one for him.

895
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:31,834
Authentic Wing Chun

896
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:33,876
Some thought Master was partial to Wong Tung.

897
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,376
In fact, he was the only one who dared to ask.

898
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:38,292
If the others had asked,

899
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:40,209
he would have done the same for them.

900
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:42,417
Now that you put up a signboard,

901
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:45,501
if you wish to turn someone away,

902
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,126
you must have a good excuse.

903
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,876
No wonder he refused
to have a sign for his own school.

904
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:54,334
It's not in his character to find excuses.

905
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,001
He'd lay it on you straight.

906
01:08:56,876 --> 01:08:59,834
With a baby on the way and money was tight,

907
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:03,042
Wong Tung took in whoever came along.

908
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:07,584
Unfortunately, few went to him for lessons.

909
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:10,376
Tung!

910
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:14,334
Nice place!

911
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:26,834
Interested in boxing in the Walled City?

912
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,167
Chan won five bouts in a row,

913
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,376
and made a ton of money.

914
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:38,626
Sing!

915
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:39,876
Hi, Sis.

916
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:42,209
We're not interested.

917
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,501
Very well.

918
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,001
I'm off.

919
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,417
Think it over.

920
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:22,292
Very well!

921
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:23,917
Bravo!

922
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:35,084
Wong Tung won 10 bouts in a row.

923
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,001
I'm very happy with the pool.

924
01:10:44,084 --> 01:10:46,417
I'll keep the money for Tung.

925
01:10:48,126 --> 01:10:52,667
I'd be even happier
if Wing Chun loses for a change.

926
01:10:58,334 --> 01:10:59,417
Happier!?

927
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:08,626
Happier!?

928
01:11:10,084 --> 01:11:11,459
Happier!?

929
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,501
Happier!?

930
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,792
Wing Chun doesn't lose so easily.

931
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:25,709
What do you know?

932
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:32,376
Master lp who teaches kung-fu upstairs?

933
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:36,334
You are his son?

934
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,667
After Mom died, Dad wanted me to join him.

935
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:43,876
I finally came in 1961.

936
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,001
Took me ages to walk to Shamshuipo

937
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:48,709
where I found his school.

938
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:52,917
Dad was a great wanderer.

939
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,709
Everyday we go for a walk after breakfast.

940
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,834
He'd take me to Central and

941
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:01,334
Sheung Wan,

942
01:12:01,376 --> 01:12:04,251
where he'd point out different stores

943
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:08,251
owned by his classmates
from St. Stephen's College,

944
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:12,251
among them Tang Shiu-kin,
the philanthropist.

945
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:13,792
Yet he has never called upon any of them,

946
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,209
as he was reluctant to ask for help.

947
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,459
He never forced me to do things

948
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:24,834
learn Wing Chun or to help out at his school.

949
01:12:25,584 --> 01:12:29,459
There's no difference being
his son or his pupil,

950
01:12:29,459 --> 01:12:31,209
I'm off job-hunting, Dad.

951
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,876
except I get to spend more time with him.

952
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:37,459
Pardon me.

953
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:42,501
Back then,
I often saw a woman who brought him meals.

954
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:45,292
I asked Dad how I should address her.

955
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:48,334
He just said "whatever".

956
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:50,876
So I decided to call her Northern Lady.

957
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:55,459
I felt relieved that Dad was being looked after.

958
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:59,001
Let's eat.

959
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:05,876
Is it good?

960
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:15,251
I finally landed a job

961
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:16,626
with a shipping company,

962
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,417
working night shift with room and board.

963
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:22,292
But on occasions,

964
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:24,126
I'd go back to Dad's for dinner.

965
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:26,917
Happy New Year, everybody!

966
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:27,751
Chun!

967
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:28,667
Chun!

968
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:31,667
Take a seat! Dinner will soon be served.

969
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,417
How's work, Chun?

970
01:13:58,459 --> 01:13:59,292
It's alright.

971
01:14:08,626 --> 01:14:11,334
If it doesn't suit you, come back and help out.

972
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:16,126
Hello! Happy new year!

973
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,751
You can stir-fry this rice cake
or make soup with it.

974
01:14:30,209 --> 01:14:30,834
I'll take that.

975
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,251
Thank you.

976
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:37,876
You should just ignore her.

977
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:40,834
Dinner is ready.

978
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:41,917
Thank you, Sheung.

979
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:42,834
It's nothing!

980
01:14:42,876 --> 01:14:44,417
Master, your favorite shrimp.

981
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:48,126
I have red packets for you.

982
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:51,334
I put them in your drawer.
Let me get them.

983
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:05,209
To his health.

984
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,251
No, we pass.

985
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:10,501
It's lucky money from Master.

986
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:11,751
I said no.

987
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:13,751
Mm mung m:

988
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:16,584
Don't be like that.

989
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:18,084
She's not Mrs. Ip.

990
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:24,792
Let's eat.

991
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,209
Dig in, everyone.

992
01:15:27,209 --> 01:15:29,042
I have to go back to work,

993
01:15:29,084 --> 01:15:30,292
let's eat.

994
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,376
Honey!

995
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:41,209
Master!

996
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:46,792
Can we take back
the blanket we gave Mrs. lp?

997
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:53,084
Why?

998
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:18,126
Don't they want someone looking after you?

999
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:25,251
Don't worry! I'll eat your rice cake.

1000
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:33,834
I'm more worried about your catching a cold.

1001
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:56,417
My pupils rented this place.

1002
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:04,001
I don't want to bother them anymore.

1003
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:10,792
What's wrong? Is it your stomach?

1004
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:23,834
Go see a doctor, if not to the hospital.

1005
01:17:30,584 --> 01:17:34,001
They say this is good for pain.

1006
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:35,292
Try it.

1007
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:40,792
Better than being in pain.

1008
01:17:45,542 --> 01:17:47,126
Drink up.

1009
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:20,209
Don't ever give me that stuff again!

1010
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:23,084
But you were in pain.

1011
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:26,001
Never touch opium!

1012
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:28,001
Remember your friend?

1013
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,167
I just don't want to see you in pain.

1014
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,501
Please forgive me.

1015
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,459
I'm not blaming you.

1016
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:03,126
Thanks.

1017
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:05,209
Honey, tell them to unload everything.

1018
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:06,042
Alright!

1019
01:19:13,292 --> 01:19:14,792
In the summer of 1962,

1020
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:18,334
Dad and I rented a flat in Mongkok.

1021
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:27,584
Northern Lady used to visit at first,

1022
01:19:28,876 --> 01:19:33,251
then for some reason she stopped coming.

1023
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:42,251
That year,
I started to learn Wing Chun from Dad.

1024
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:48,334
The Government announced today...

1025
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:52,209
daily water supply is cut to four hours.

1026
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,917
Turn it off downstairs!

1027
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,001
What?

1028
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,084
Turn off the tap!

1029
01:19:58,376 --> 01:19:59,834
Sure!

1030
01:19:59,834 --> 01:20:01,292
Olives-in-flight! Up here...

1031
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:12,876
Dad took on more pupils back then.

1032
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:14,709
Some would even picked him up in fancy cars

1033
01:20:15,126 --> 01:20:19,626
and drove him home for private tuitions.

1034
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:23,292
Rumors got out that

1035
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:27,084
Dad only taught for money.

1036
01:20:28,334 --> 01:20:34,167
The winning lottery number is 03420877.

1037
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,709
3420877

1038
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:40,667
No. 3 typhoon signal is hoisted.

1039
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:44,251
Typhoon Wanda is forecasted to hit Hong Kong.

1040
01:20:45,084 --> 01:20:47,792
A higher signal will be hoisted later.

1041
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:51,126
Citizens are advised to stay home

1042
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:53,709
and take precautions.

1043
01:20:54,251 --> 01:20:57,042
Stay away from windows and open areas.

1044
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:00,084
But I will never

1045
01:21:00,084 --> 01:21:01,209
throw a match.

1046
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:04,792
People come to see Wing Chun.

1047
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:08,209
Call it off for all I care.

1048
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:14,376
You're a nobody without my arena.

1049
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,626
Who do you think you are? The star?

1050
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,834
Don't you dare go against my will!

1051
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,626
If I can make you,

1052
01:21:24,876 --> 01:21:26,334
I can also break you.

1053
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,334
Tung-tung, let's hang this up for dad...

1054
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:43,042
$100 on Wong Tung to win.

1055
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:43,626
I bet $40.

1056
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:44,501
Wong Tung!

1057
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:47,292
Iron-Fist Ngai Ba-tin vs Wing Chun's Wong Tung

1058
01:21:50,751 --> 01:21:53,042
King, babysit for me.

1059
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:01,667
Sei Mui!

1060
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,459
The typhoon is coming,

1061
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:04,501
where are you going?

1062
01:22:09,084 --> 01:22:10,459
I have a sweet deal for you.

1063
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,167
Let's make it more interesting.

1064
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:15,834
How interesting?

1065
01:22:16,834 --> 01:22:18,834
5 to 1 if you kill him.

1066
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:22,209
I'd love to make you happy,

1067
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:27,417
but it's not easy to kill this guy.

1068
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,876
Don't worry, just wait...

1069
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:31,626
Help is on the way.

1070
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:33,626
Can I have your autograph?

1071
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:34,376
Sure!

1072
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:37,751
Will you take me as your pupil?

1073
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:38,459
Yes!

1074
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:40,709
And me, too! Chan, give him the address.

1075
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:41,584
Very well!

1076
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:43,834
Have a soda pop for good luck.

1077
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:44,376
Thank you!

1078
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:48,417
Now I get it.

1079
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:13,834
Bravo!

1080
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:15,626
Nail him!

1081
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:43,667
Brother Tung!

1082
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:19,584
Let him have it...

1083
01:24:20,334 --> 01:24:21,084
Sing!

1084
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:22,876
They've drugged Tung!

1085
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:26,042
Save him!

1086
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:27,751
Beat him up...

1087
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:31,209
Beat him up...

1088
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:34,709
Halt!

1089
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:35,876
Ignore him!

1090
01:24:35,876 --> 01:24:36,459
Carry on!

1091
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:38,917
Stop the bout!

1092
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,417
Is this a boxing match,

1093
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:43,834
or a game of death?

1094
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:46,251
You had him drugged, asshole!

1095
01:24:46,251 --> 01:24:48,334
I am calling the shots here.

1096
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,667
The hell with you!

1097
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,001
I'm taking him with me.

1098
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:54,334
Finish the bout,

1099
01:24:54,334 --> 01:24:56,001
and he can go with you.

1100
01:24:56,334 --> 01:24:57,417
Carry on!

1101
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:01,584
Tung!

1102
01:25:02,376 --> 01:25:03,167
Tung!

1103
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:04,251
Tung!

1104
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:08,251
Are you okay?

1105
01:25:15,084 --> 01:25:16,209
Out of my way!

1106
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:18,167
I won't care if you're pregnant or not!

1107
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:23,792
Tung!

1108
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:30,876
Who are you? Why are they here?

1109
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,209
I am lp Man, I come for my pupil.

1110
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:34,334
Have you sought Dragon's permission?

1111
01:25:34,584 --> 01:25:35,751
Where is he?

1112
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:36,626
Inside.

1113
01:25:36,626 --> 01:25:37,334
Thank you!

1114
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:40,001
They've drugged Tung!

1115
01:25:56,292 --> 01:25:56,876
Brother Tung!

1116
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:58,167
Brother Tung!

1117
01:25:58,542 --> 01:25:59,292
Hang in there, Tung!

1118
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,417
Master has come to take us home.

1119
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:15,084
Tung! Hang in there!

1120
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:15,584
Master!

1121
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:16,084
You're okay?

1122
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:17,251
They've drugged him!

1123
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:20,501
Sing!

1124
01:26:21,584 --> 01:26:22,376
Take him back to the station.

1125
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:24,167
Anything can happen inside the ring.

1126
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:27,084
Don't blame us if your pupil
wasn't good enough.

1127
01:26:27,334 --> 01:26:29,251
I won't interfere if the fight was fair,

1128
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:31,626
but that was plain murder.

1129
01:26:31,626 --> 01:26:32,501
You have to answer for this.

1130
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:36,626
He made me lose money

1131
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,751
and you came looking for trouble.

1132
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:40,667
You'll have to pay for this.

1133
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:42,709
Sing

1134
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,376
What are you waiting for? Arrest him!

1135
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,001
This is the Walled City,

1136
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:48,584
it's outside the police's jurisdiction.

1137
01:26:50,626 --> 01:26:51,834
Hang in there, Tung!

1138
01:27:00,209 --> 01:27:01,001
Master.

1139
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:04,376
Sing!

1140
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:07,001
If I take them out of the City,

1141
01:27:07,292 --> 01:27:08,751
can you do your job?

1142
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:10,001
Yes!

1143
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:11,876
As soon as they set foot outside,

1144
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:14,792
my men will arrest them.

1145
01:27:15,834 --> 01:27:17,917
Very well.

1146
01:27:18,209 --> 01:27:20,209
Take Tung and Sei Mui with you,

1147
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,209
and ask your men to wait outside.

1148
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:26,667
Do as I say, go.

1149
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:29,584
Yes!

1150
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:32,292
Give me a hand!

1151
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,084
Hold on!

1152
01:27:33,792 --> 01:27:34,792
Sing! Get going!

1153
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:36,001
Go!

1154
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,667
Ip Man, you have no say on my turf.

1155
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:39,376
I'm not after your turf.

1156
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:40,876
I'm after you.

1157
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:41,834
We shall see!

1158
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:51,834
Stay alert!

1159
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:53,209
Run along!

1160
01:31:58,667 --> 01:31:59,501
Take them away!

1161
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:01,001
Yes, Sir!

1162
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:03,126
Master!

1163
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:05,334
Are you alright?

1164
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:15,209
One day in 1968,

1165
01:32:15,709 --> 01:32:18,001
Dad asked me if I had time to accompany him

1166
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:19,667
to visit Northern Lady who had lung cancer.

1167
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:22,542
So we went to the Haven of Hope Hospital.

1168
01:32:23,209 --> 01:32:26,001
It was quite a journey
to Rennie's Mill in those days.

1169
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:27,917
First by bus, then by ferry,

1170
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:29,917
before ending with a long walk.

1171
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:33,834
Dad said nothing throughout the trip.

1172
01:32:43,209 --> 01:32:44,126
One slice is enough.

1173
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:46,459
It's my stomach...

1174
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:51,209
I'm sorry.

1175
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:52,709
I don't want to waste it.

1176
01:32:58,209 --> 01:32:59,667
When did you find out

1177
01:33:00,376 --> 01:33:03,417
that I didn't make those dishes?

1178
01:33:04,376 --> 01:33:06,501
I knew the first time you came.

1179
01:33:08,251 --> 01:33:10,209
Bing Kee's dishes are known to be salty.

1180
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:12,709
Why didn't you say something?

1181
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:17,251
Sometimes things are best left unsaid.

1182
01:33:26,251 --> 01:33:27,834
I don't really understand...

1183
01:33:28,417 --> 01:33:30,251
what the doctor said.

1184
01:33:34,376 --> 01:33:36,334
Do you still remember

1185
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:39,292
what I was most afraid of?

1186
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,709
I promise...

1187
01:33:53,584 --> 01:33:55,501
you won't be alone.

1188
01:34:10,792 --> 01:34:12,459
When the time came,

1189
01:34:13,084 --> 01:34:14,709
Dad was with her the whole time.

1190
01:34:14,751 --> 01:34:20,167
They say life is like a dream

1191
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:27,334
but I say dreams reflect life

1192
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:33,792
that is full of joy and excitement.

1193
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:38,209
A short life

1194
01:34:38,459 --> 01:34:45,167
embraces sorrow and worries.

1195
01:34:50,001 --> 01:34:54,167
One of Dad's pupils went to the U.S.

1196
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:56,042
When he came back

1197
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:57,834
he was already an international film star.

1198
01:34:58,251 --> 01:34:59,084
Master!

1199
01:35:02,334 --> 01:35:03,667
Long time no see.

1200
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:06,292
These are my pupils.

1201
01:35:07,292 --> 01:35:09,209
Nice to meet you, Grandmaster!

1202
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:10,334
Good, be seated.

1203
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:11,876
Please...

1204
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:15,626
I remember you don't like cold tea.

1205
01:35:21,084 --> 01:35:22,501
I can manage.

1206
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:27,626
Master...

1207
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:28,917
American cigarettes

1208
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:34,126
What's the big deal?

1209
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:38,667
Master!

1210
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:40,334
No thanks.

1211
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:41,417
I prefer to walk.

1212
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:45,084
Let me walk you home.

1213
01:35:46,876 --> 01:35:48,209
Are you tired?

1214
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:49,084
Do you need a ride?

1215
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:53,042
I'd rather walk while I still can.

1216
01:35:54,126 --> 01:35:56,334
They say you didn't approve of me.

1217
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,251
Do you still consider me your pupil?

1218
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:02,042
Am I still your Master?

1219
01:36:02,417 --> 01:36:03,876
Of course... I'm not saying...

1220
01:36:03,876 --> 01:36:05,917
Wing Chin can never be changed.

1221
01:36:06,334 --> 01:36:09,084
There'll be no progress without changes.

1222
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:10,667
Master!

1223
01:36:11,084 --> 01:36:13,001
I want to film you practicing
with the wooden dummy.

1224
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:14,542
Film?

1225
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:16,626
I want to introduce Wing Chun to the world.

1226
01:36:17,084 --> 01:36:18,834
To the world? Good idea.

1227
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:22,209
After we're done with filming,

1228
01:36:22,626 --> 01:36:24,126
I'll buy you a new apartment.

1229
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:29,917
I'll do it when the time is right.

1230
01:36:55,751 --> 01:36:56,626
Then one day,

1231
01:36:56,626 --> 01:36:59,709
Dad asked me to film him
with the wooden dummy.

1232
01:37:04,126 --> 01:37:04,667
He said...

1233
01:37:04,667 --> 01:37:07,292
the footage is for posterity.

1234
01:37:16,209 --> 01:37:17,584
Do you need a break?

1235
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:25,084
Wing Chun...

1236
01:37:25,084 --> 01:37:26,251
belongs to everyone.

1237
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:37,209
One's conduct should be modeled after a tree,

1238
01:37:39,084 --> 01:37:41,917
the trunk is rooted while its leaves flourish.

1239
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:45,876
Whereas one's attitude should be like a coin,

1240
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:49,542
square on the inside while smooth on the edges.

1241
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:05,584
Ip Man-The Wing Chun Grandmaster
